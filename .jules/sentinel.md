## 2026-07-23 - Enforce Strict File and Directory Permissions
**Vulnerability:** Directories (`MkdirAll`) and files (`WriteFile`, `OpenFile`) were created with overly permissive bits (`0o755` and `0o644`), which could allow local cross-user tampering or info leakage in multi-user environments.
**Learning:** For a local daemon managing sync states and potential user data configurations/logs, even systemd/launchd configs and workdirs must restrict access exclusively to the owner (`0o700` and `0o600`).
**Prevention:** Always verify file/directory creation uses the strictest required permission (`0o600` for files, `0o700` for directories). Do not default to typical shared `0o644`/`0o755` unless access by other users is an explicit, verified requirement.
## 2024-05-24 - Prevent Path Traversal in Go 1.24+

**Vulnerability:** The application was using `os.Open(filepath.Join(localRoot, ".driveignore"))`. This is vulnerable to directory traversal if `.driveignore` is a malicious symbolic link pointing outside of `localRoot` (e.g. to `/etc/shadow`), which could result in an attacker manipulating the application to read arbitrary sensitive files.

**Learning:** `os.OpenRoot` was introduced in Go 1.24 to provide a secure, scoped file system handle. When you need to read files within a specific directory context and want to guarantee that accesses cannot escape that context (e.g., via `..` or symlinks), `os.OpenRoot` is the correct defense-in-depth approach compared to manually resolving and validating paths.

**Prevention:** Use `root, err := os.OpenRoot(baseDir)` followed by `root.Open(file)` instead of `os.Open(filepath.Join(baseDir, file))` for safely handling user-controlled or potentially untrusted file/directory structures.
## 2026-08-06 - Prevent Path Injection in Systemd Unit Generation
**Vulnerability:** Systemd unit file generation (`autostart_linux.go`) was vulnerable to command splitting and path injection because it did not quote the executable path or escape systemd specifiers (`%`, `$`).
**Learning:** When writing systemd unit files via Go templates or string formatting, paths containing spaces or special characters will be interpreted as multiple arguments or systemd variables, potentially allowing execution of arbitrary commands.
**Prevention:** Always quote executable paths (e.g., using `%q` in `fmt.Sprintf`) and escape systemd specifiers (`%` to `%%`, `$` to `$$`) when generating unit files from user-controlled or variable paths.
